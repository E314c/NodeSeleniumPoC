This repo is here for me to drop in some selenium automation code I had to write up for a PoC.  
Mainly because it'll be easier to get VM'd jenkins to pull this down than it would be to manage syncing the files
to the VM and then cleaning them after each build.  

It'll probably also be a useful reference should I have to come back to this kind of thing later on.  

If you're looking at automation testing in Javascript, it's worth checking out these too:  
[Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/)  
[Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)  
I haven't personally tried either yet, but cypress has that classic modern javascript "ooo shiny" feeling about it.
